# ReactComponentKit

ReactComponentKit is a library for building UIViewControllers. You can make UIViewControllers based on Components. Also, It uses MVVM and Redux architectures for unidirectional data flow.

## Data Flow

 * (1) : Components dispatch actions
 * (2) : ViewModel passes the actions to the store. You can use beforeDispatch(action:) method to do some work before dispatching actions.
 * (3) : Store passed current state to the Redux pipeline. Middlewares, Reducers and Postwares make a new state.
 * (4) : New State comes out from the Redux pipeline. It is passed to the store.
 * (5) : Store passes the new state to the ViewModel.
 * (6) : ViewModel passes or propagates the state to the Components.

## Components

ReactComponentKit provides four components basically. 

 * UIViewComponent
 	* It is a basic component for making a scene. It is just a UIView that has some convenient methods for dispatching actions and receiving states.
 * UICollectionViewComponent
 	* It is a component for making a scene that uses UICollectionView.
 * UITableViewComponent
 	* It is a component for making a scene that uses UITableView.
 * UIViewControllerComponent
 	* It is a component for spliting a massive view controller. 

## Examples

 * [Counter](https://github.com/ReactComponentKit/Counter)
	* Counter is a very simple and basic redux example.
 * [EmojiCollection](https://github.com/ReactComponentKit/EmojiCollection)
 	* EmojiCollection is a example for using UICollectionView and Diff algorithms.
 * [UserList](https://github.com/ReactComponentKit/UserList)
	* UserList is focus on requesting api asynchronously.
 * [GitHubSearch](https://github.com/ReactComponentKit/GitHubSearch)
 	* GitHubSearch is an example for ReactComponentKit. It searches repositories or users on Github.com.
